          <h3>Air to Water Heat Pumps</h3>
          <p>HOW DO HEAT PUMPS WORK? A heat pump system harnesses energy from free renewable sources outside the building, for heating your house and producing your hot water. Electrical heat pumps use a compressor to draw heat from a low temperature source, such as external air or ground to heat the building interior. While conventional heating systems such as storage heaters and boilers cannot produce more heat than that contained in their fuel source, a heat pump typically will produce three to four units of heat for every unit of electricity consumed.</p>
