        <p>If you have a leak and need someone to call out straight away please <a href="contact.html"><button>Contact us</button></a> Excessive water pressure can cause stress on your plumbing leading to leaks and burst pipes. If you hear banging from your pipes (known as a water hammer) this is a sure sign of high water pressure. It may mean that the water pressure from your supplier to your house is too high.</p>

        <p>Locate the main water supply and shut it off to stop the flow of water, preventing additional damage. Leave the faucets on to fully drain the pipe and relieve any remaining pressure, and flush all toilets. Depending on where the leak is, you may also need to shut off the electricity.</p>

        <img src="assets/images/underfloor.JPG" alt="Under floor heating pipes">
        <p>Underfloor heating is an effective alternative to traditional heating systems. These underfloor heating kits heat a space from the ground up and because they run at a lower temperature, they use less energy and cost less money. Underfloor heating pipe can be installed with many types of floor and give more flexibility in space design. This type of heating warms the whole room, meaning fewer cold spots.</p>
